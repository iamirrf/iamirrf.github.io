        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am actively dedicated to advancing my knowledge in the fields of machine learning and AI engineering. My pursuit of knowledge is characterized by a growth mindset, a remarkable ability to adapt to new technologies, and an unquenchable thirst for learning. What truly ignites my passion within this field is the convergence of business and artificial intelligence. Consequently, I have chosen to complement my computer science major with a minor in Business Administration, forging a holistic understanding of both the technical and strategic facets of this domain. Python is my programming language of choice, and I have amassed practical experience in utilizing various data and machine learning libraries, including TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas, among others. Recognizing the paramount importance of effective communication in both personal and professional spheres, I have conscientiously pursued a minor in Communication, in addition to undertaking various personal initiatives aimed at honing my social skills. This commitment reflects my belief that the ability to articulate ideas clearly is pivotal in the realm of technology-driven innovation. Beyond academics and professional aspirations, I nurture my creative side through the art of photography, which serves as an outlet for my imaginative faculties. Moreover, I am an ardent chess enthusiast, finding in the game an arena for strategic thinking and intellectual challenge.
